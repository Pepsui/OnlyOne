# TODOs

Figure out movement bug
Try to figure out how to free an object so you can say whether something won or lost
Start on data structure with taking in movement and replaying it back from an array

## Main loop implementation

Was thinking of having an array of movement data, with input button and length of timing being in each element of the array. Then we would have an entity that would take in that array, and with the same body as the character, just read through the array and do the same movements and what was in the array
